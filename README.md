This python script is a part of color sorting machine, which give output to colour of tiny round beads [here:(Orange,Blue,Pink)] to the Microcontroller with by serial communication.
This project uses a microscopic camera, zoomed in to the bead detecting color with help og HSV values.
In the script to get a more acccurate prediction, the script takes Average of 5 uniform points placed on the beads. This is to ensure good results which are prone to error to position of beads due to mechanical error.
